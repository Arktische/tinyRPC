* CPU: Intel CPU with AVX support (commonly after skylake)
> If you use other platforms, the project is **NOT** guaranteed to compile and run correctly.
## Architecture

The whole project is divided into few steps, in each piece you will write your code into the skeleton code.

* [lab0](lab0/lab0.md)
    * installation of development tools & env configuration
* [lab1](lab1/lab1.md)
