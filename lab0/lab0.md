In this piece you will install development tools and configure the environment step by step.

## Installation

you need install `gcc/g++`, `cmake`, `git`(optional) on your linux.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install googletest
```

After executing those commands successfully, you are ready to go :)

## Env configuration

You can execute `setup.sh` to configure all the dev environment. Or you can follow the next few steps:

```bash
sudo apt install googletest
cd /usr/src/googletest/ && mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make && make install
```

**NOTE**:You might need `sudo` to execute those commands.
